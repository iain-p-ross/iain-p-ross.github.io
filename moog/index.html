           <p>In the early 1960s, electronic music technology was impractical and used mainly by experimental composers to create music with little mainstream appeal. 
             <br>
             <br>
             In 1963, American engineer Robert Moog, who designed and sold theremins, met composer Herb Deutsch at a New York State School Music Association trade fair. Deutsch had been making electronic music using a theremin, tape recorder, and single-pitch oscillator, a time-consuming process that involved splicing tape. Recognizing the need for more practical and sophisticated equipment, Moog and Deutsch discussed the notion of a "portable electronic music studio".
             <br>
             <br>
          Moog received a grant of $16,000 from the New York State Small Business Association and began work in Trumansburg, New York. At the time, synthesizer-like instruments filled rooms; Moog hoped to build a more compact instrument that would appeal to musicians. Learning from his experience building a prohibitively expensive guitar amplifier, he believed that practicality and affordability were the most important parameters.
          <br>
          <br>
          Previous synthesizers, such as the RCA Mark II, had created sound from hundreds of vacuum tubes. Instead, Moog used recently available silicon transistors — specifically, a transistor with an exponential relationship between input voltage and output current. With this, he created the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which generated a waveform whose pitch could be adjusted by changing the voltage. Moog designed his synthesizer around a standard of one volt per octave. Similarly, he used voltage to control loudness with voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs).[4]
          Moog developed a prototype with two VCOs and a VCA. As the VCOs themselves could output voltage, one could be used to modulate the output of another, creating effects such as vibrato and tremolo. 
          <br>
          <br>
          According to Moog, when Deutsch saw this, he "went through the roof" and immediately began making music with the prototype, attracting the interest of passersby: "They would stand there, they’d listen and they’d shake their heads ... What is this weird shit coming out of the basement?"</div>

                <h3>Mike Adams : CEO</h3>
                <p>Mike has a background in mechanical engineering as well as manufacturing, which seemed to fit perfectly when he began working with Bob Moog back in 2002. Bob was looking to expand his small company and to finally complete work on the Minimoog Voyager, which he has been working on for several years. Mike began working at Moog Music as a consultant and soon became a partner in the business and later the president. He was able to work with Bob for only three and a half years before Bob became ill. Bob passed away in 2005. Since that time Mike has continued to run the company in the direction Bob made possible through his innovative and creative instrument designs.</p>

                  <h3>Cyril Lance : Chief Engineer</h3>
                  <p>Cyril Lance met Bob Moog at the Moog Factory in January of 2005. They chatted that day for several hours about their shared passions for physics, their similar studies at Cornell University and their love for music. When Bob was diagnosed with a brain tumor just three months later, he asked Cyril to take over the engineering efforts at Moog while he underwent treatment. On the strength of their one conversation, Bob knew that Cyril was the right engineer to lead Moog in his absence. Since April 2005, beginning with the finalization of the Little Phatty, Cyril has been at the helm of Moog's engineering and product development, overseeing the design of synths such as the Taurus 3, Minitaur, Sub 37, theremini and the Animoog (Moog's best selling synth of all-time).</p>
